Promotion (& Trainee) Patches



____________________________________________________________________________


1. 3 Promotion Branch Options

Allows units to have three options when promoting. Edited from the Promotion Branches editor found in the advanced editors menu.

2. Split Promotion Items (Installer/Editors)

This patch has an installer and two editors: an editor for promotion items which promote units into 1 specific class and an editor for promotion items which offer split promotions

This patch allows you to set certain promotion items to promote units into specific classes. i.e. you can set a hero crest to promote a mercenary into a hero while an orions bolt promotes a mercenary into a ranger. Normally mercenaries cannot use orions bolts so you would still have to set the list of classes which can use an orions bolt to include mercenaries in the general promo items editor (found in the advanced editors menu). You can still set items to offer classes split promotional paths. For example, you can set a hero crest to turn a mercenary into a hero, but a fighter would get the option of promoting into a hero or a warrior. Note that only one split is possible, that is if you set fighters to have the option of turning into a hero or a warrior with a heros crest, you will not be able to use a different item to offer a different set of choices. However, you can set a hero crest to give fighters the option of promoting into a hero or a warrior while a knights crest promotes them into specifically a great knight thereby giving units additional promotion options based on the promotion item used.

3. Display/Hide Weapon on promote

This patch is a toggle that will hide weapons upon animation. This is useful if one class for example uses swords but promotes into a class that cannot use swords. In this scenario, the game will crash. However, by hiding the weapon you can prevent the game from crashing. Of course this doesn't look as cool, but unfortunately there is no way to detect whether the unit is holding an un-animatable weapon before trying.

4. Allow 3 or more trainee to be regist (Installer/Editor)

This patch allows you to label additional units as trainees. Trainees are handled by the character when that character is a specific class. Trainees promote automatically at a certain level (which can be set in the editor).

5. Toggle Trainee Automatic Promotion

This is a simple toggle patch, i.e. search it up in the patch window, pick the setting you want and hit "Write to ROM". I don't recommend turning this off as trainee classes will then require an item to promote.

6. Modify S Rank Limits

I know this is neither a promotion patch nor a trainee patch but it is the only weapon rank patch I recommend. It is a simple toggle patch which allows units to become S rank in every weapon they use. I never understood why units were limited so I think it's a good patch.

7. Lose Weapon Ranks on Promotion

By default Ewan is the only unit to lose the ability to use a weapon when promoted from a pupil to a shaman. His loss of anima magic was hardcoded. This patch makes it dynamic so any unit promoting into a class that lacks the use of a pre-promote's weapon will lose that weapon rank.

I don't think this should be used because I don't think a character would "forget" how to use a sword just because s/he was promoted into a class that doesn't use swords.

Can change the default loss of Ewan's weapon rank with
- Ewan weapon rank removal on Promotion


__________________________________________________________________________________


- Remove game clear requirement for trainees third promotion options
- Level does not decrease with promotion
- Level after promotion (set units to promote to a specific level after promotion)
- Minimum Promotion Level (set the minimum level for units to promote)
- Trainee Promotion Table
- Max weapon level for unpromoted classes

Menu Promote Command (BUGGY!!)

I believe the idea behind this patch was to give units the ability to promote without promotional items based on whether certain other conditions were met. However, I haven't succeeded in getting it to work as it seems buggy and causes my game to crash. If you want a character or unit to promote automatically at some point I would suggest making the unit a trainee via one of the trainee patches and setting the level and flag requirements accordingly.
