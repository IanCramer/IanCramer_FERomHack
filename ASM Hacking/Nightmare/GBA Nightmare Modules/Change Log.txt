Following Module Changes as of:

September 16th, 2012:

- Removed two modules; an outdated duplicate version of the Spell Association Editor and a duplicate of the CG Editor
- Updated the Battle BG Array Editor with a complete list of backgrounds
- Updated the Chapter Data Editor to include all chapters in the game (including special maps)
- Updated the Event Reference Table Editor to include all chapters in the game (including special maps)
- Updated the Character Editor to use unsigned growth values
- Updated the Class Editor to use unsigned growth values
- Removed the pretty much pointless "Documentation" folder
- Made some minor yet helpful tweaks to the following modules:

	- Item Editor
	- Stat Bonuses Editor (now the "Custom Stat Bonuses Editor")
	- Standing Map Sprite Editor
	- Miscellaneous Map Sprite Editor
	- Death Quote Editor Part 1 (now Part 1-2; the new README explains this a bit)
	- Death Quote Editor Part 3 (see note above)
	- Specified Battle Conversation Editor
	- Unspecified Battle Conversation Editor

I didn't update any of the modules to reflect the new version # or the fact that I updated them but if you're seeing this then they should be updated.
