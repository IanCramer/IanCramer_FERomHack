What originally was known as the "part 1" editor, which affected Lyn's mode, was actually two separate parts--however, the format for both parts 1 and 2 are the same.

You'll notice a blank entry midway through the module--one with all 00's--this is the separator between the two parts. DO NOT EDIT THIS! It may result in some glitches in your game.

The death quote editor part 2 is for bosses and non-Lyn's Mode characters.

Sadly I'm not 100% sure about the specifics of when the different death quote sections are called upon and this is pretty much all I can tell you. Just be careful with this and read a tutorial on it if possible as it may help you out with the specifics quite a bit. Be especially careful when repointing, too!
