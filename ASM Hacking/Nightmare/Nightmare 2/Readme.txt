Welcome to my (Hextator's) version of Nightmare.

In the folder you've found this file should be the following key elements of getting use out of this
utility:

- doc: Documentation folder. Contains key information about making use of the utility.
- dist: Distribution folder. The editor is literally distributed in this folder; the .jar file named
	"Nightmare 2.jar" within is the Java executable ARchive that you must have a Java Runtime
	Environment (preferably the latest version) to execute, in which the editor resides.
- License.txt and COPYING: More important than you think, these files give the short and long version
	of the license this application has been released under, respectively. It is this license that
	allows you to freely play with this (under certain reasonable circumstances detailed in the
	license):
- src: Source folder. The gears of the utility are contained here. If something about the app is
	particularly awesome, the code (likely written by me but specified if otherwise) within this
	folder is the cause. If there is a glaring bug and/or other type of issue with the editor, you
	can blame the same thing for that, too. Edit: actually, no, maybe you can't. I've just learned
	(the hard way) that my IDE is able to corrupt itself and therefore the project, causing bugs
	even when and where I've coded things correctly.
- Release Info.txt: This file contains a history of all the releases and other modifications to the
	utility. It also contains information about known bugs and planned features. I consider it
	required reading each time a new release is reported.

And that's about it. Enjoy~
