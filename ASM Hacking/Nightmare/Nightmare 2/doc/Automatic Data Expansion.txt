This feature only works correctly with files intended for systems that use 32 bit pointers!

Don't click the "Expand" button if the module you have open is, for example, for an old Gameboy
ROM.

To use this feature, simply click "Expand" (it will be a button under the entry list in the
module's dialog) (you may not always be able to do this if, for example, if the data is already
expanded or the default entry count is too large) and the application will copy the original
array of data the module is for editing, replace the old location with 00s, append 0xFF bytes
onto the end until the array has the next highest number of entries it can based on the size of
the index values that access it (256 or 65536; no higher values are supported), write the
result to the end of the file and update all the pointers to it.
