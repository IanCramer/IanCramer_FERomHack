Files that aren't require to be a multiple of 4 bytes in length might not work appropriately
as Nightmare 2.0 pads the files with 00 bytes until they are before doing any checksum calculation,
as well as ensuring this requirement is met for working with the file in general.

The bitmap example has been pre-padded appropriately to accommodate this.
