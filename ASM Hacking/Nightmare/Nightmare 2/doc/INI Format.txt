The name of the INI file should be equal to the string produced by this formula:

String.format("%08X.ini", (int)fileChecksum);

If the file has been modified, use the last 4 bytes of the file for "fileChecksum" instead of
calculating it.

An example INI name would be the default one for Fire Emblem 7. Fire Emblem 7's unaltered checksum is
0x2A524221. So, the file name should be "2A524221.ini". "2a524221.ini" won't work.

First line should be "[Basis]" if and only if you don't want the INI to be deleted when a file that
uses the INI is modified.

All lines after the first line, or including the first line if it isn't "[Basis]" should be full paths
to the modules to load when files with the checksum the INI is named after are encountered.

Each time a file is opened, the directory is searched for INI files named after that file's checksum.
If a match is found, that .ini is assumed to be associated with the opened file. If the .ini is not a
"basis", then when a new .ini is automatically created when saving the file, the old .ini will be
deleted.

Automatically generated INIs will only have the full paths of the CURRENTLY open modules added to them.
This means that if you open a module and then close it before saving, it won't be added to the list.
