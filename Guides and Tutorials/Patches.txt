	Might be called "Skill SkillSystem" or something like that. Get the most recent. Installing and removing this patch can break your game. This patch includes many patches as a package/suite. The included patches are below marked by what can and what can't be removed after install

- ExModularSave
	Careful of this patch. While it is ultimately better to include the patch (especially as part of the skill system patch) it changes the way the ROM read and writes save files. Save files made by ROMs with this patch will not be readable by ROMs without it and vice versa. However, many other patches rely on this patch and not having it can lead to game crash if dependent patches are installed. Installing and removing this patch can break your game. This patch is included in the Skill System Patch.
