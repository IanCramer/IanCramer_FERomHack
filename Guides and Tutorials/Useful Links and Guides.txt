Features to add to vanilla:

1. Revistable Arenas
	Place arenas in maps that generate skirmishes. Can also prevent arenas from becoming ruins by:
		1. From the Advanced Editors menu select "Tile Changes" to access the tile changes editor
		2. Select the map you'd like to edit (prevent arena from becoming ruins in)
		3. In the list of tile changes, identify which tile change turns the arena to a ruin.
		4. Drag said tile change to the bottom of the list.
		5. Under the list of tile changes, click "Data Expansion"
		6. Reduce the number of tile changes by 1. (note the data expansion screen will by default offer to increase the number of tile changes when we want to decrease it. Be sure to set the number of tile changes to allocate to 1 less than the number of existing tile changes.)

2. Unbreakable legendary weapons and dragonstone

3. Adjust stat boosts of dragonstone

4. Create newer weaker, breakable version(s) of the dragonstone. i.e "Fire Stone". Set Myrrh to have a fire stone when she joins. Set Morva to drop the dragonstone.

5. Set shops so that all items are available and purchaseable

6. Create super classes which promoted classes will be able to change into via the master seal.

7. Summoning Changes

8. Reset Seal

9. Non monster skirmishes

10. Skirmishes spawn at all maps
