This is a very simple project to create 5 chapters where in Ephraim leads his attack into Grado (as in the one Erika then tries to rescue him from).
















Things to do:
1. Rip dragonstone icons from Fire Emblem Storge
2. Rip Dragon animation from Fire Emblem Storge
3. Rip Elephant Riders Animation from Fire Emblem Storge?
