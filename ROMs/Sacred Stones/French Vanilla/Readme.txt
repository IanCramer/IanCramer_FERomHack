French Vanilla is a game mod which should be used as a base for future mods. It contains a few major changes and several minor changes to gameplay. The Features are listed below.



Changes/features:

1. Skill SkillSystems
	This patch has been installed, however, this patch automatically adds a skill or multiple to each unit. I have set the skills to be only what they are in the vanilla game. Again, as this ROM will be used as a base, skills can (and probably would) be added as desired but this way only the vanilla skills already exist in this ROM.

2. All bows have been granted an additional 1 range except short bow which has critical hit doubled.

3. The following items have been made not to break:
	Dragonstone
	All sacred weapons (Latona was increased to 10 uses)

4. Shops and Armories have been edited to ensure (almost) all weapons and items are available somewhere in the game.


1. Poison lance is now weapon level D (other poison weapons already were)
2. Longbow is now weapon level C.
3. Several arenas were added and made replayable in skirmishable maps







To Do:
1. Adjust in map shops and armories
2. Add Custom Spell Animations (From magic extends menu in advanced editors)
3. 



Story:


Dialogue:

When confronting the "Jaffar" like character:
Main Lord: "Are you the one who killed my father?"
Jaffar: "..."
Main Lord: "Are you?! -> ANSWER ME!"
Jaffar: "The shadow league killed your father."
Main Lord: "But you are the one who swung the blade, no? You are the one!"
Jaffar: "In the shadow league, there is no "one". We have no thoughts,
	we make no decisions.
	In the shadow league we are all but limbs of a single monster.
	I am naught but an arm. If you met the one who killed your father
	would you cut off his arm? No, you would cut off his head.
Main Lord: "Cutting off his arm seems like a good place to start!"
Second Lord: "______! No!"
*Main Lord attacks Jaffar. Misses. Jaffar lands a critical hit significantly
depleting the Lord's Health.*
