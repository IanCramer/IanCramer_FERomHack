French Vanilla is a game mod which should be used as a base for future mods. It contains a few major changes and several minor changes to gameplay. The Features are listed below.



"Major" Changes:

1. Skill SkillSystems
	This patch has been installed, however, this patch automatically adds a skill or multiple to each unit. I have set the skills to be only what they are in the vanilla game. Again, as this ROM will be used as a base, skills can (and probably would) be added as desired but this way only the vanilla skills already exist in this ROM.

2. All bows have been granted an additional 1 range except short bow which has critical hit doubled.

3. The following items have been made not to break:
	Dragonstone
	All sacred weapons (Latona was increased to 10 uses)

4. Shops and Armories have been edited to ensure (almost) all weapons and items are available somewhere in the game.







Minor Changes:

1. Poison sword is now weapon level E (other poison weapons already were)
2. Longbow is now weapon level C.
3. Several arenas were added and made replayable in skirmishable maps







To Do:
1. Adjust in map shops and armories
2.
