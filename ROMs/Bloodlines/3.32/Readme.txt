BLOODLINES 3.1
Readme
Base game: FE7U
Contains 19 Chapters (It is not complete)
Recommended Emulator: Visual Boy Advance (VBA). This was NOT tested on m-GBA or VBA-M, so you will most likely experience unintended bugs due to m-GBAs accuracy. For the best gameplay experience, use VBA. 

-Notes/Bugs-

- Because its the first version of 3.0, stress testing Bloodlines/looking for glitches will likely yield unexpected results. This may cause cutscenes to crash entirely.

- There is also a lot of ASM/mega wizardry here, as well as experimental AI that may or may not work properly in the odd circumstance - If anything looks/feels really strange or may literally crash, its probably because it wasn't an expected behavior from AI.

- Finishing the last chapter will bring you to the "End of Patch" Chapter
- If you try to skip a riddle cutscene, the game may hang. You'll need to hit restart to get out of it.
- hitting B to skip cutscenes might merge a bunch of cutscenes together at times, so if you press B, just expect that it could happen.
- Battle Win Loss display on the unit stat menu has a bugged Loss number for recruited units
- Old Horn use item text is bugged: does not display "Constitution Increased" but instead "Any other Requests?"

--Special Thanks--

Alusq: OG team member. contributed to virtually every single aspect of Bloodlines since day 1, he's the reason the music sounds so good. A great guy and for the last almost 7-8 years of this project's many, many hiatuses, he was always ready and willing to get right back to the project when I came back from my breaks. Legit MVP. 

Endelphia: OG team member, never failed to get a request done. Always down to chat. Has always provided sprite and story feedback. Has always been a great friend throughout the years.

Fire Blazer: For inspiring me to push new ideas and helping me learn the basics. Without his direct assistance, I'm not sure how the project would look like right now. 

Primefusion: One of the best guys I know. Has supported me in more ways than one throughout the project. One of the few people I could divulge personal information to whenever I needed a friend to speak to. Stand-up guy and fantastic hacker himself.

Stan: Came in towards the end and saved the project from not being released. This version would not be out by now were it not for his kindness and wizard brain.

Tequila: OG member. So much of what Bloodlines is and feels like is because of this man. So many hours of custom ASM for the project, enjoys hanging in the Discord to call, never gives up no matter how difficult the task is or how annoying I am.

Valravn: Supported me greatly throughout the early years of the project and always believed in it. I still remember his praise from our Skype conversation back in the early years. Look at us now.

Vega Regius: An incredibly talented concept artist and writer who had a keen sense of exactly what I needed for my characters. His designs have made so many characters and animations truly memorable.
